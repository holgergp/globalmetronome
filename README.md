## Information about Scott Hudsons Work
This metronome is based on Scott Hudson great work for an Offline Javascript Metronome, that runs in your browser without internet connection.

### History
Scott Hudson used @cwilso's [HTML5 demo metronome](http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/metronome/index.html) as a starting point.

### Features
Scott added several features to @cwilso's [HTML5 demo metronome](http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/metronome/index.html) which are commonly seen in professional metronomes, including:

* variable meter input
* support for triplet subdivisions
* master volume toggling
* accent volume toggling
* subdivision volume toggling
* material design UI

Furthermore Scott added triplet note support, which was the trickiest to implement, since it required converting the base note interval from a 16th note to a twelvelet, which contains both eighth note and sixteenth note intervals.

### Offline Use
Scott mentioned that Chrome doesn't like running web workers locally apparently. Chrome is widely used browser and the offline check in 2021 of the Scott's metronome did not work in Chrome now.

## Setup
1. clone the repository or [download the GitHub-ZIP of this repository](https://github.com/niebert/metronome/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. open `index.html` using a browser and start the metronome.

### Todos
* toggle note pitches
* tap tempo detection
* easy sound file import
* add visual metronome
